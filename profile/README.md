## Packet Blade

Packet Blade is an open source hardware project run by
[Sidings Media](https://github.com/SidingsMedia) that aims to
provide a high density platform that allows for a cluster of
ARM based routers within a standard 19" rack. In order to
provide maximum modularity and configurability, the individual
blades sport an Eurocard form factor with a DIN 41612 connector
to connect to the backplane. This allows all components including
power supplies to be entirely hot swappable. It also allows for 
the system to be customised to suit the particular operating 
environment.

The project aims to be a cheap way to create a complex multi
router environment, whilst not causing the power bill to go
through the roof.

## Roadmap

We aim to have a mostly functioning router board by mid-January
2023. A more detailed roadmap can be found below

Late September 2022   - Initial design of board complete  
October 2022          - Testing of first prototype
November 2022         - Design modifications and further prototypes
Late November 2022    - Power supply module complete
December 2022         - Software / Firmware complete, ready for beta
Mid-January 2023      - Beta release of board
